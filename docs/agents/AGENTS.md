# Agent execution instructions

Before advising the repository owner or writing a prompt for another agent, read `PROMPTING_HANDOVER.md` and the normative `PROMPTING_STANDARD.md`. Use the handover to inspect live repository state and use the standard to construct the prompt. Return a direct recommendation in Polish, a compact reason, and one ready-to-paste worker prompt.

Before substantial implementation, product-facing validation, audit, E2E, PR cleanup, or task closeout, read and follow `DELIVERY_COMPLETENESS_AND_CLOSEOUT.md`. It is mandatory for prompt eval discipline, trust boundaries, delivery classification, client/backend or producer/consumer completeness, independent audit, real E2E, exact-head validation, related-PR terminal states, and archival. A worker summary is not terminal evidence.

Before creating, claiming, resuming, updating, handing off, or closing any task under this directory:

1. Read `EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`.
2. Read `PROJECT_LANES.json`.
3. Select or preserve the correct `project_lane`; use `otclient-v2` for the OTClient v2 project and `otclient` for the existing project.
4. New OTClient v2 task IDs should use the `OTC2-` prefix; existing `OTC-` task IDs remain valid for the original project.
5. Treat the task record and Git/PR state as durable; treat the worker session as disposable.
6. Execute one bounded phase per session and persist a checkpoint before a long-running or failure-prone operation.
7. Do not remain active while waiting for CI, dependencies, external evidence, deployment, or a user reply.
8. On a blocker, preserve coherent work, record `status`, evidence, blocker and exactly one `next_action`, then end the session.
9. Record `execution_mode` and let the worker decide whether Chat/GitHub or Codex is appropriate.
10. At a synchronization barrier, run `python tools/agents/control_room.py --format markdown` and escalate only material decisions.
11. Do not call a user-facing capability complete while any required backend, client/frontend, integration or consumer layer is missing.
12. Before `completed`, require independent audit PASS, required E2E PASS, exact-head required CI PASS, zero unresolved review threads, zero unintentionally open related PRs, terminal task state and released ownership.

These rules supplement the repository root `AGENTS.md`. When rules overlap, follow the more restrictive safety requirement.

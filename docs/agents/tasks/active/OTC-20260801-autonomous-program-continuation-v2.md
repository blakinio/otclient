# OTC-20260801 — Autonomous program continuation v2

## Objective

Make one short owner invocation authorize a long, low-noise autonomous programme run that checkpoints safely, completes and archives terminal tasks, crosses barriers, and continues with the next ready work until a real stop condition is reached.

## Scope

Documentation and agent-governance contracts only.

Owned paths:

- `docs/agents/PROMPTING_STANDARD.md`
- `docs/agents/PROMPTING_HANDOVER.md`
- `docs/agents/AUTONOMOUS_PROGRAM_CONTINUATION.md`
- this task record

No runtime, protocol, proprietary asset, production, Canary, upstream, or deployment mutation is authorized.

proven:
  - Current v2 prompting rules checkpoint durable state but do not explicitly require a coordinator to archive a completed task and continue to the next READY task in the same owner invocation.
derived:
  - A normative autonomous-program loop can remove premature task-by-task returns while preserving client, protocol, asset, and cross-repository gates.
unknown:
  - Exact final CI result for this documentation branch.

# OTC-20260801 — Autonomous program continuation v2

## Objective

Make one short owner invocation authorize a long, low-noise autonomous programme run that checkpoints safely, completes and archives terminal tasks, crosses barriers, and continues with the next ready work until a real stop condition is reached.

## Scope

Documentation and agent-governance contracts only.

Owned paths:

- `docs/agents/PROMPTING_STANDARD.md`
- `docs/agents/PROMPTING_HANDOVER.md`
- `docs/agents/AUTONOMOUS_PROGRAM_CONTINUATION.md`
- this task record

No runtime, protocol, proprietary asset, production, Canary, upstream, or deployment mutation is authorized.

proven:
  - The standard now distinguishes bounded worker sessions from a multi-task owner invocation.
  - The new contract requires terminal task finalization, archival, barrier review, and continuation with the next READY task.
  - The handover routes resolvable short commands into execution rather than returning a prompt.
  - Client, protocol, asset, Canary, upstream, and production restrictions remain authoritative.
derived:
  - One short programme command can now drive long foreground work without treating each checkpoint or completed task as an owner-interaction boundary.
unknown:
  - Required exact-head CI result for PR 159.
